# Expired Posts

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg) [![Latest Stable Version](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/zerosonesfun/expired-posts.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/zerosonesfun/expired-posts)

A [Flarum](http://flarum.org) extension. Mark posts as expired. An alternative to https://github.com/FriendsOfFlarum/prevent-necrobumping. Huge thanks to the Friends of Flarum group for the necrobumping extension. This uses their code and changes things up a bit so that there are no replies after so many days and the post is clearly marked as expired.

composer require zerosonesfun/expired-posts
